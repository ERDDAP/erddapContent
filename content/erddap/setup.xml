<!-- bigParentDirectory is the absolute path on the server (with slash at the end)
to a directory on a drive with lots of space. 
You must create a new directory, outside of the tomcat directory, for this purpose.
The user that runs Tomcat must have read/write privileges for this directory.
Subdirectories that will be created by ERDDAP are: 
* datasetInfo (which some datasets use to cache information about the dataset
   to speed up reloading the dataset in the future), 
* flag (where you can put a file with a datasetID's name to force reloading of 
   that dataset) and 
* cache (which ERDDAP uses to hold cached data files - ERDDAP periodically
   removes files older than cacheMinutes (see below)).
The ERDDAP log file (log.txt) will be put in this directory.
At ERD, we use '/u00/cwatch/erddap/' for releases.

For ERD releases, we use

<!-- Daily status reports and all error messages are emailed to emailEverythingTo.
Daily status reports are emailed to emailDailyReportsTo.
Either of these can be not specified, blank (specified but with no value), 
  a single email address (e.g., john.doe@noaa.gov),
  or a comma-separated list of email addresses.
The first emailEverythingTo email address is more important than the others,
  e.g., it is used for subscriptions to EDDXxxxFromErddap datasets.
See the email account settings below.

Whether or not you set up the email system, all potential email messages

<!-- Email account information is used for sending emails to the 
'emailEverythingTo' and 'emailDailyReportsTo' email addresses above
and for sending emails related to subscriptions. So if you don't setup the 
email system, your ERDDAP won't support subscriptions (including allowing other
ERDDAP's to subscribe to datasets on your ERDDAP).

If you don't want your ERDDAP to send emails, change the emailSmtpHost tag 
contents to be nothing.

It is a security risk to put your email password in a plain text file like this.
To mitigate that problem, we strongly remommend that you:
1) Set up an email account just for ERDDAP's use, e.g., 
   erddap@yourInstitution.org 
   That has other benefits as well: more than one ERDDAP administrator can then
   be given access to that email account.
2) Make the permissions of this setup.xml file rw (read+write) for the user who 
   will run Tomcat and ERDDAP (user=tomcat?) and no permissions (not read or
   write) for the group and other users.

emailProperties is a list of additional properties in the form 
  prop1|value1|prop2|value2
The default is nothing.

If possible, set this up to use a secure connection (SSL / TLS) to the email server.

For gmail (even your.name@noaa.gov accounts which are managed by Google), 
  for emailSmtpHost, use smtp.gmail.com
  for emailSmtpPort, use 587
  for emailProperties, use mail.smtp.starttls.enable|true

Whether or not you set up the email system, all potential email messages 
are logged to an emailLogYEAR-MONTH.txt file in [bigParentDirectory]/logs/.

If you can't get ERDDAP to send emails (error = "Connection refused")
and you are using anti-virus software (e.g., McAfee) make sure McAfee 
"Virus Scan Console : Access Protection Properties : 
Anti Virus Standard Protections : 
Prevent mass mailing worms from sending mail" is un-checked.

Note that when a dataset is reloaded, all files in the

In general, only image files are cached, because the same images are often 
requested repeatedly.
Removing files in the cache based on age (not Least-Recently-Used) 
ensures that files won't stay in the cache very long. 
Although it might seem like a given request should always return the same 
response, that isn't true. 
For example, a tabledap request which includes time>someTime will change 
if new data arrives for the dataset. 
And a griddap request which includes [last] for the time dimension will change

No matter what, each dataset won't be reloaded more often than its 
reloadEveryNMinutes value as specified in datasets.xml.

The only disadvantage to setting this to a smaller number is that 
it will increase the frequency that ERDDAP retries datasets that aren't

the data source might consider it pestering/aggressive behaviour.

<!-- Tabledap Examples
This group of settings is used to make examples for the tabledap documentation 
that appears at [baseUrl]/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html and elsewhere.
If you include the erdGlobecBottle dataset in your datasets.xml (recommended), 
you don't need to change these.
If you don't, you MUST change these before you make your ERDDAP public; 
otherwise, none of the examples will work!
The new settings should be very similar to the defaults.
If your ERDDAP won't serve any tabular datasets, use "NOT_APPLICABLE" for all of the enties.
In .xml files like this, ampersand, lessThan, and greaterThan have to be 
HTML encoded as "&amp;", "&lt;", "&gt;".
-->
<!-- This is the datasetID for an EDDTable dataset that is served by your ERDDAP.
     This dataset is used as the basis for all of the EDDGrid examples below. 
     Ideally, it is a dataset that has longitude, latitude, and time variables (among others). 
     ('time' allows for making a time series graph. 'latitude' and 'longitude' allow for making a map.)
     The dataset can have longitude values -180 to 180, or 0 to 360. -->

landmask should be drawn "over" or "under" surface data on maps.

"under" is the default and is suitable for all data.

<!-- startHeadHtml has the start of the HTML document and the 'head' tags 
(starting at "<!DOCTYPE>", but not including "</head>") 
for all HTML web pages. 
This may include &erddapUrl;, which is expanded to be [baseUrl]/erddap
  (or [baseUttpsUrl]/erddap if the user is logged in).
If your ERDDAP allows users to log in, all referenced image files, css files, 
  etc. must be in [tomcat]/content/erddap/images or a subdirectory
  and must be referenced here with &erddapUrl;/images/[fileName].

favicon.ico is the image that browsers associate with your website.
More more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon .
You can use your own favicon.ico file by putting it in 
(tomcat)/content/erddap/images. 

*** Optional: you can change the appearance of all of your 
ERDDAP's HTML pages by changing the CSS <style> settings below.

For an example of a very different style, change the import reference to
  [tomcat]/content/erddap/images/erddapAlt.css

*** If your CSS style includes links to files (e.g., images), that style
information must be inline in the style tag below, after the 'import' line, 
not in the .css file.  
Put all of the (e.g., image) files in the [tomcat]/content/erddap/images
directory (or a subdirectory) and reference them below starting with
&erddapUrl;.
Why? On ERDDAP https: web pages, *all* links should use https: (not http:);
otherwise, most browsers consider the web page not fully secure.
Because ERDDAP would use the same .css file for http: and https: web pages,
the links within the .css file wouldn't switch between http: and https:.
There doesn't seem to be a way around this other than using inline style 
information.
